# One-Page 'About Me' Website
_By Gary Pang_

This is a single-page website that I built in October 2015 as part of my application to General Assembly's Web Development Immersive bootcamp in New York City. I used Bootstrap for this project.

The live version is at www.codewritingcow.com. As I add more Web projects to my portfolio, I'll showcase them on the website.
